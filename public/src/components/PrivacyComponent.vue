            <p>Cookies help us serve you better.</p>
            <p>Think of cookies as crumbs. Every time you visit a website, that website saves bits of your visit so they

                years.
            </p>

                You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to
                turn off all cookies. Exactly how you do this would depend on your device's privacy settings.
                If you turn your cookies off, some of the features that make your site experience more efficient may not
                function properly.
